# WSDL2JavaWO
Generate WebObjects Java beans based on a given WSDL

This is an archive of one of some WebObjects utilities I created 
at the days I was actively involved in WebObjects and other J2EE software development projects.

I think that should be no real value nowadays, it just serve as a historical record :)

Cheers.
